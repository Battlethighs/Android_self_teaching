=====================

Number adder: Enter numbers separated by commas, and then press 'calculate'. The adder will give you the sum of the numbers. Press the 'back' button at the BOTTOM of the phone to return to the main scree and enter new numbers to add. Pressing the UPPER 'back' button does not work. Additionally, make sure you only include integers and commas in your entry, or the program will encounter an error!
